These models were trained with Phi-3 datasets that include both synthetic data and the filtered, publicly available websites data, with a focus on high quality and reasoning-dense properties. Phi-3.5 Mini uses 3.8B parameters, and is a dense decoder-only transformer model using the same tokenizer as [Phi-3 Mini](/models/microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct).\n\nThe models underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.","3494/48425/28583/na/na/26834/429",588,0.000024946,{"enabled":5,"available":5,"type":6,"subtype":7,"provider":8,"id":2234,"model":2234,"route":2235,"description":2236,"max_tokens":1748,"max_response_tokens":25,"latency":2237,"query_count":2238,"img_price":16,"img_json":16,"avg_cost":2239,"price_type":18,"input_cost":2240,"output_cost":2241},"jamba-1-5-large","ai21/jamba-1-5-large","Jamba 1.5 Large is part of AI21's new family of open models, offering superior speed, efficiency, and quality.\n\nIt features a 256K effective context window, the longest among open models, enabling improved performance on tasks like document summarization and analysis.\n\nBuilt on a novel SSM-Transformer architecture, it outperforms larger models like Llama 3.1 70B on benchmarks while maintaining resource efficiency.\n\nRead their [announcement](https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-jamba-model-family) to learn more.","3326/22462/9842/na/3804/9859/481",626,0.0010724228,2.00623539,7.99981917,{"enabled":5,"available":5,"type":6,"subtype":7,"provider":8,"id":2243,"model":2243,"route":2244,"description":2245,"max_tokens":1748,"max_response_tokens":25,"latency":2246,"query_count":2247,"img_price":16,"img_json":16,"avg_cost":2248,"price_type":18,"input_cost":2249,"output_cost":2250},"jamba-1-5-mini","ai21/jamba-1-5-mini","Jamba 1.5 Mini is the world's first production-grade Mamba-based model, combining SSM and Transformer architectures for a 256K context window and high efficiency.\n\nIt works with 9 languages and can handle various writing and analysis tasks as well as or better than similar small models.\n\nThis model uses less computer memory and works faster with longer texts than previous designs.\n\nRead their [announcement](https://www.ai21.com/blog/announcing-jamba-model-family) to learn more.","1412/4858/3242/na/na/3171/546",587,0.0000631876,0.20031177,0.39999008,{"enabled":5,"available":5,"type":6,"subtype":7,"provider":8,"id":2252,"model":2252,"route":2253,"description":2254,"max_tokens":1912,"max_response_tokens":13,"latency":2255,"query_count":2256,"img_price":16,"img_json":16,"avg_cost":2257,"price_type":18,"input_cost":1742,"output_cost":2258},"l3.1-euryale-70b","sao10k/l3.1-euryale-70b","Euryale L3.1 70B v2.2 is a model focused on creative roleplay from [Sao10k](https://ko-fi.com/sao10k).

(Preview) is a research preview of OpenAI’s latest language model, designed to advance capabilities in reasoning, creativity, and multi-turn conversation. It builds on previous iterations with improvements in world knowledge, contextual coherence, and the ability to follow user intent more effectively.\n\nThe model demonstrates enhanced performance in tasks that require open-ended thinking, problem-solving, and communication. Early testing suggests it is better at generating nuanced responses, maintaining long-context coherence, and reducing hallucinations compared to earlier versions.\n\nThis research preview is intended to help evaluate GPT-4.5’s strengths and limitations in real-world use cases as OpenAI continues to refine and develop future models.
